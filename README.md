# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using VGG16

This project focuses on identifying different types of brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning and transfer learning. It leverages the VGG16 model to accurately classify MRI images into the following categories:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

---

## 🖼️ Dataset

The dataset consists of brain MRI images categorized into four classes. The images are preprocessed, resized, and augmented to enhance training performance and prevent overfitting.
